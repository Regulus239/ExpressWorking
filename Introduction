This project is designed to help people work more utilities which means we can not only work with our hands.

The first idea coming out is a system operated by eyes movement. As we know, eyes could transmitting a huge amount of
information. If we collect them with lens and connect the eyes movement to some certain things we do everyday. We would
alse provide an eye attached screen or an appliction on PC which could offer options of the choices we used to make in
the specific locations and time.

User stories
For the simple use, we could open curtains and lights when we arrive home with only looking at them. When we are working
on the computer, we could use a brand new way to operate them. For instance, if we staring at a loction for 1.5s and a 
window will jump out offering the operations of opening, deleting, renaming and so forth. When we are outside, if we walk
pass a restaurant and staring at it for a moment during lunchtime, the screen will show today's discount cuisines and may
even make a reservation for you.

The recognition of eye movement will be realized by computer vision skills like openCV.
